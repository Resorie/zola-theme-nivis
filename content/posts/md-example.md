## Text Basics
You can make text **bold** or *italic*.
You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ or highlight `inline code` variables.

## Headings

Acknowledge that we recommend using `h1` (in markdown, single `#`) only for the title (that is, the `title` attribute in front matter). The titles in post content should start with `h2`.

### h3
#### h4

`h5` and `h6` are not recommended to use. (Actually I didn't implement a style for them lol) Try use lists to replace them.


## Lists & Checkboxes
**Unordered List:**
* Apple
* Banana
    * Cavendish
    * Plantain
* Cherry

**Ordered List:**
1.  Initialize repo
2.  Stage files
3.  Commit

**Task List:**
- [x] Draft content
- [ ] Review for typos
- [ ] Publish

## Code Blocks
**Python:**
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num));
```

## Tables

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tables | Yes | Pipes and dashes |
| Alignment | Yes | Colons define it |
| Complexity | Low | Keep it simple |

## Math Formulas (LaTeX)

Markdown renders math using LaTeX syntax. Refer to the [configuration post](/posts/configure) for how to use it.

**Inline:** The mass-energy equivalence is `$e=mc^2$`.

**Block (Display):**
```math-display
$$
f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi x}d\xi
$$
```
