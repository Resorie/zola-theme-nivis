Live demo: [my blog](https://resorie.github.io/blog/).

This theme is inspired by (and derived from) themes [Float](https://float-theme.netlify.app/) and [anatole](https://longfangsong.github.io/). Really appreciate these two wonderful themes :smile:

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo into your `themes/` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resorie/zola-theme-nivis.git themes/nivis/
```

Then, change your theme config in `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "nivis"
```

Move on to the [example site](https://resorie.github.io/zola-theme-nivis/) for more info. Enjoy it! :kissing_heart:
